Ah 2017, what a year. As the year closes with the festive season, there is no better time to think back to all the things that have happened.

<!--more-->

### Music

The year started off with a trip up to Bright, where I spent a week at the Bright Tuba and Euphonium Festival. I found this to be a fantastic learning opportunity, and I continue to put into practice what I learned from Tim Buzbee and Roland Szentpali. While the festival will not be running next year, I will be still heading up to Bright for a different camp, the Bright Brass and Percussion Summer Intensive (quite the mouthful!), hosted by the wonderful Phillipa Edwards and Jamie Lawson of the Footscray Yarraville City Band.

### University

I also managed to survive my first year of university, meeting many new friends along the way. Studying Computer Science at Monash has so far been a great enjoyment for me, as I've set off on the path of becoming a ~software developer~ ~programmer~ ~computer engineer~ all-around-cool-guy (_who knows what the proper job title is anymore_)

<!-- WIRED -->

Outside of continuing a strong academic performance, I also took part in several 'hackathons' with my peers, even managing to take out a prize at UniHack 2017 with the Bosch IoT Award at Unihack Mini. (Read more [here](../unihack-2017/)).

### Moving Forward

As 2018 nears, I look forward to continuing to maintain a standard of excellence. With my new job at monPlan, the nearing Australian National Band Championships over the Easter weekend, and not to mention a whole 'nother year of university coming up, 2018 looks to be bigger, busier and more than exciting than anything before it.

**I welcome the challenge**
