    <strong>MonPlan</strong>
    <br>
    <em>JavaScript (React, Redux, React DnD)</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="https://monplan.apps.monash.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><em>monplan.apps.monash.edu</em></a>
  </p>
</div>

-   I was a frontend developer with a team of students, and together we delivered Monash University's **first online course planning service**.
-   I gave MonPlan a major UI upgrade over 2018, making it **responsive** and **accessible** to all users while upgrading our UI framework under the hood.
-   We also introduced new features, including course advice from faculty staff and enrolment validation, while maintaining existing functionality for our student users.

<div class="left-right-divide">

    <strong>Mellophone</strong>
    <br>
    <em>TypeScript (React), Python (Django) with GitLab CI</em>

    <a href="https://github.com/nchlswhttkr/mellophone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><em>github.com/nchlswhttkr/mellophone</em></a>
  </p>
</div>

Mellophone is an app for taking meeting minutes, which I started it as a hobby project to explore new technologies and to own the full stack.

-   The frontend is **React (TypeScript)** with tests using **React Testing Library**.
-   Backend is a **Django** application that follows RESTful principles.
-   **GitLab CI** pipeline runs unit tests and end to end tests before deploying to a **DigitalOcean** droplet.
-   I taught myself **Docker** to set up an controlled environment for development and CI.

### Skills & Interests

I'm most confident with the frontend web stack, building with **React** and using developer tools to ensure an accessible and consistent user experience.

I'm keen about automation, and like to use CI/CD in my work to test and deploy my projects to **DigitalOcean**, **AWS** and **GCP**. Recently, I've been using **GitLab CI** and **Buildkite**.

Currently, I'm teaching myself **Golang** and exploring **Docker** further. I believe in learning by applying, and try to show this through my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/nchlswhttkr) for others to see!
