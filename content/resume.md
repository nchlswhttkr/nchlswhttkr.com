### Skills & Interests

I'm always keen to **solve problems** and to learn new concepts and technologies. I believe in **learning through application**, and so I try to publish my work on [GitHub](https://github.com/nchlswhttkr) when possible! I'm currently in love with automating testing and deployments with **CI/CD**.

I'm passionate about developing applications and ! I've worked with frameworks such as **React**, **Django** and **Express**, and deployed projects with **AWS**, **GCP** and **Digital Ocean**.
