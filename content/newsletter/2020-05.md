Another few weeks, another newsletter! I've finally updated the [subscriber form](https://twitter.com/nchlswhttkr/status/1257889431266013184) to look like an actual form, and also done [some work under the hood](https://github.com/nchlswhttkr/website/commit/0d1b7ea35f8e4e170e80ae903f1186f22238b4cc) to make writing this newsletter less of a hassle (less templating, more markdown!).

Plus, links now show you the site you'll be taken too if you click on them!

### Why Server-Side Input Validation Matters

Even if it comes from your frontend, you can't assume it will be friendly. Case in point, Twitter's gender field.

### Project Lightspeed

Rewriting a gargantuan application takes a proportional amount of engineering effort. Take a look at what was done differently for Facebook Messenger, given an opportunity to shed technical debt.

### Doom Eternal Developers React to 27 Minute Speedrun

IGN's series on developers reacting to speedruns of their games is great to watch, both for (often broken) gameplay and the accompanying discussion.

### This Is Magnolia - Magnolia

I saw this posted by an artist I follow last week, and I'm loving the instrumentation behind it.

I really like _"New Gold Mountain"_ and the way it mixes a flugelhorn, piano and steel guitar with a healthy dose of distortion.

### Journey - Austin Wintory

[Journey](https://thatgamecompany.com/journey/) is one of the earliest games I can recall becoming completely enamoured with. Much like the game itself, the soundtrack has an enourmous amount of character for something so barren.

Hearing _"The Road of Trails"_ brings me right back to 2012, sand-surfing with a faceless companion.
