I've been working on getting a mailing list up and ready for this newsletter this week.

To put it through its paces though, I need to send out an email. Luckily, I've got plenty of content for a new edition of my newsletter!

### Websockets with Elm Using Ports

I can't quite get my head around some of the syntax of functional programming languages, but seeing them in application with other modern web technologies is cool to read about!

### The Problem With Thread^W Event Loops

I love technical writeups from Cloudflare, plain and simple.

See their discussion on the event-loop model, and approaches they considered for mitigating issues with long-running requests.

### February 28th DDoS Incident Report

With the increased load on networks at the moment with all the VPN traffic and people working from home, it seems fitting to look at how GitHub was able to weather one of the largest DDoS attacks in recent history!

### Hayao Miyazaki's Airships

The Royal Ocean Film Society does a lot of interesting studies on movies and movie-making, and to see them explore the significance of planes and the skies in Hayao Miyazaki's works is a pleasure.

### Sonic 3D's Impossibly Compressed Logo FMV - How's it Done?

If you ever want to see workarounds as a result of memory/hardware limitations, look no further than games programming!

### The Rain World Animation Process

I think Rain World is a one-of-a-kind game with its procedural animation, and in 30 minutes I hope you'll share my love for the work of the team at Videocult on this fascinating game!

### Ori and the Will of the Wisps OST - Gareth Coker

Ori and the Will of the Wisps is finally out after all these years!

Even though I don't yet have the setup to play it, I'm still excited about the soundtrack's release!

### Strange Satisfaction - Woody and Jeremy

Good tunes from good lads, I'll listen to anything Woody Goss is a part of, so this album is another welcome addition to the collection!

My favourite track is definitely _"On the Phone with the Song"_, but the pre-chorus _"Fat Boys in the Gym of Love"_ gets an honourable mention.
