I've been working on getting a mailing list up and ready for this newsletter this week.

To put it through its paces though, I need to send out an email. Luckily, I've got plenty of content for a new edition of my newsletter!

{{% newsletter-description %}}
With the increased load on networks at the moment with all the VPN traffic and people working from home, it seems fitting to look at how GitHub was able to weather one of the largest DDoS attacks in recent history!

The Royal Ocean Film Society does a lot of interesting studies on movies and movie-making, and to see them explore the significance of planes and the skies in Hayao Miyazaki's works is a pleasure.

I think Rain World is a one-of-a-kind game with its procedural animation, and in 30 minutes I hope you'll share my love for the work of the team at Videocult on this fascinating game!

Strange Satisfaction - Woody and Jeremy
{{%/ newsletter-title %}}
{{% newsletter-description %}}
Good tunes from good lads, I'll listen to anything Woody Goss is a part of, so this album is another welcome addition to the collection!

My favourite track is definitely _"On the Phone with the Song"_, but the pre-chorus _"Fat Boys in the Gym of Love"_ gets an honourable mention.
