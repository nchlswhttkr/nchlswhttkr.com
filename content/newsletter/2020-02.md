### The Pedestrian: Original Soundtrack - Logan Hayes

Along with the aforementioned game, Logan Hayes has put together a fitting soundtrack.

I like the _Rush Hour_ tune, it feels reminiscent of Herbie Hancock's _Cantaloupe Island_.

After 5 years away, it's good to have Kevin Parker back! I've been really enjoying this for the past few weeks since it's launched.

Favourite track is definitely _"One More Year"_, the vocal effects are hypnotising.

We're barely into 2020 and I think we've already got one of the best puzzlers of the year. You navigate levels by arranging and connecting tiles, you'll need a sharp mind once the difficulty picks up!

Vinny from Vinesauce has been streaming this recently, and it's been enjoyable to watch.
