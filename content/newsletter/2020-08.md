### Pysa

Big companies with big codebases are often a nightmare to analyse and keep secure. I think it's particularly interesting how Facebook uses with Psya to identify insecure data flows in their Python code.

Iconic for its visual style, there's plenty to learn about the way the world of this Zelda game is designed and lit.

### Woody Goss - The Third Story Episode 137

I'm not too much of a podcast person, but it's often a great way to hear interviews with people I follow. The Third Story episode is great if you've got a spare hour to tune in.

### The Universe Smiles Upon You - Khruangbin

I first heard Khruangbin being played in the background at a jazz club at the end of last year. Another patron sitting at my table, who'd travelled down from Queensland for the week, was kind enough to give me the band's name. Fast foward to today, and I now own all of their albums!

I really enjoy _"White Gloves"_ on this album, what else can I say?
