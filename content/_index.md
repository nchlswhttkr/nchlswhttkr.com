## Hey, I'm Nicholas!

## :wave: :wave: :wave:

I'm a developer in Melbourne, Australia. Aside from code, music is a strong passion of mine. Most evenings of the week you'd be sure to find me rehearsing with a brass band or orchestra. Outside of music, I also enjoy playing a good game of lawn bowls.

I'm currently studying Computer Science in a Monash University. Outside of studying and community involvement, I also work with eSolutions at Monash University as a developer. My most notable past work includes helping to build and release [MonPlan](https://monplan.apps.monash.edu/), an interactive course planner for students, as an enterprise service for the university.
