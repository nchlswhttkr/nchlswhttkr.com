## Hey, I'm Nicholas!

I'm a developer in Melbourne, Australia. Web development and automation are my passion, and I'm always looking to explore new things and share what I learn with those around me!

In my spare time, I rehearse and play with brass bands and orchestras around Melbourne. Catch me playing euphonium or trombone at street marches or competitions!

I studied Computer Science at Monash University, and helped launch a new course planning service for staff and students, [MonPlan](https://monplan.apps.monash.edu/). I've also been a part of running hackathons and workshops for IT students as a volunteer and committee member for [WIRED](https://wired.org.au/).

Currently, I'm a part of the logistics crew with [UNIHACK](https://unihack.net/), running hackathons for students at Australian universities.
