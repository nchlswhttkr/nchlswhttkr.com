## Hello World!

## :wave: :wave: :wave:

### I'm Nicholas, a developer in Melbourne, Australia

I'm a fan of many things, including cats, comics, and coding. Music is my passion, and most evenings of the week you'd be sure to find me rehearsing with a brass band or orchestra. Outside of music, I also enjoy playing the occassional game of lawn bowls.

I'm currently studying Computer Science in a Monash University. Outside of studying and community involvement, I also work with Monash University eSolutions as a developer. Some of my past work includes helping to build [MonPlan](https://monplan.apps.monash.edu), an interactive course planner for students.
