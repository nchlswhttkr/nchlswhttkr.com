# Hello World!

## I'm Nicholas, a student developer in Melbourne Australia!

I'm a fan of many things, including cats, comics and, of course, coding. Coffee isn't quite my jam, but I do love a good hot chocolate!

I'm currently studying Computer Science in a Monash University. Outside of my studies, I take part in hackathons with my friends and work as part of [WIRED](http://wired.org.au/), promoting IT at Monash! I'm also excited to work with [MonPlan](https://monplan.github.io) as the UI/UX Lead, making course planning a better experience for students at Monash!

When I'm not writing code or studying, I'm likely off rehearsing or performing with a brass band or orchestra somewhere across in Victoria. I also play a little of bit of lawn bowls on the side.
