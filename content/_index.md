## Hello World!

## :wave: :wave: :wave:

### I'm Nicholas, a developer in Melbourne, Australia

I'm a fan of many things, including cats, comics, and coding. Music is my passion, and most evenings of the week you'd be sure to find me rehearsing with a brass band or orchestra. Outside of music, I also enjoy playing the occassional game of lawn bowls.

I'm currently studying Computer Science in a Monash University. Outside of my studies, I'm a part of the team at [WIRED](http://wired.org.au/), supporting IT and its students at Monash! I'm also excited to work as developer on [MonPlan](https://monplan.github.io) with eSolutions at Monash University, making course planning a better experience for students at Monash!
