## Hey, I'm Nicholas!

I’m a developer in Melbourne, Australia. Aside from coding, music is my strongest passion. Most evenings of the week, you’ll be sure to find me rehearsing with a brass band or orchestra in Melbourne. Outside of music, I also enjoy playing a good game of lawn bowls.

As a developer, I'm always looking to solve technical problems, gain experience with new technologies, and grow my own knowledge so that I can share it with those around me.

I'm currently studying Computer Science in a Monash University. Outside of studying and community involvement, I also work with eSolutions at Monash University as a developer. My proudest work was helping to build and release [MonPlan](https://monplan.apps.monash.edu/), an interactive course planner for students, as an enterprise service for the university.
