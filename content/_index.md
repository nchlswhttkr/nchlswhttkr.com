## Hey, I'm Nicholas!

I'm a developer in Melbourne Australia, with a passion for music. Most evenings of the week, you'll be sure to find me rehearsing with a brass band or orchestra around Melbourne. Outside of music, I also enjoy playing a good game of lawn bowls!

I'm keen for frontend web development and automation, but working with the full stack isn't something I shy away from! I'm always looking to learn new technologies to put them into use, and to share what I learn with those around me.

I study Computer Science at Monash University. I've been involved with IT at Monash through the [WIRED](https://wired.org.au), with the hackathons and workshops for students interested in IT. I've also worked with eSolutions at Monash University, and launched [MonPlan](https://monplan.apps.monash.edu) with a team of fellow students to make study planning and online course advice accessible and understandable for Monash students.
